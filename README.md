# frontend
front-end application to upload file and get back word count

To run the application clone or download this application and https://github.com/CryptoAlgorythm/backend

Once you have downloaded this application cd into openlaw-frontend and run npm install

# then

Once you have downloaded https://github.com/CryptoAlgorythm/backend cd into the openlaw-backend directory and run npm install
now run npm start.

You should now have a node server running on port 3000

Now return back to the openlaw-frontend folder and run npm start and you should now have a running application to upload a file

I have included a test file in the https://github.com/CryptoAlgorythm/openlaw-backend/public directory for you to upload into the application
